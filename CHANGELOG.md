## [Unreleased]

## [0.1.0] - 2026-08-16

First published release.

### Added

- Fast mutation testing driven by per-line coverage: only the tests covering a
  mutated line are rerun, mutations are applied in memory rather than on disk,
  mutants run in parallel forked workers, and results are cached across runs.
- JSON Lines results with a derived plaintext view whose every line starts with
  a fixed status keyword, so `grep SURVIVED` works without knowing the schema.
- Zero-configuration operation: source layout and test suite are discovered
  from the project root.
- Five mutation operator families: arithmetic, boolean, boundary, comparison,
  and constant.
